shop - store - A store that holds the state of your application

Intention to BUY_CAKE - action - An action that describes the changes in the state of your application.

Shopkeeper - Reducer - A reducer which actually carries out the state transistion depending on the action

*****************************************************************************************************************

There are three principles

First P: 
"The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store"

Maintain our application state in a single object which would be managed by thr redux store.

Cake Shop -
Let's assume we are tracking the number of cakes on the shelf
{
    noOfCakes: 10
}


SecondP: 
"The only way to change the state is to emit an action , an object describing what happend"

To update the state of your app, you need to let redux know about that what an action.

Not allowed to directly update the state object

Cake Shop -
Let the Shopkeeper know about our action - BUY_CAKE
{
    type: BUY_CAKE
}


ThirdP: 
"To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers"

Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState

Cake Shop -
Reducer is the Shopkeeper
