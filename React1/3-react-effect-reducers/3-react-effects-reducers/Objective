useeffect: 
function ExampleComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This is the "effect"
    // Your code here

    // Clean up function (optional)
    return () => {
      // Clean up code here
    };
  }, [dependency1, dependency2, ...]); // List of dependencies (optional)

  // Your component render logic here
  return ...;
}
Here's what the different parts of the useEffect Hook do:

useEffect: This is the Hook itself. It accepts two arguments: a function that contains your effect logic, and an optional array of dependencies.

Effect function: This is a regular JavaScript function that runs after the render has happened. You can perform any side effect in this function, such as modifying the DOM, fetching data, or updating some state.

Dependency array: This is an optional array of values that represent what your effect depends on. If any of these values changes, the effect will re-run. If you omit the dependency array, your effect will re-run on every render.

Clean up function: This is an optional function that runs before the next effect starts. You can use it to undo any changes you made in the effect.

The useEffect Hook lets you express side effects declaratively, just like you do with your component's render logic. It ensures that your effects run only when necessary, and that your component stays fast and predictable.
