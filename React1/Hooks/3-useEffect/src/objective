useEffect:- useEffect is something which helps us to perform side effects in our react application

Now what is side effect?
Side effect is something which gives unpredictable output / result or actions which are performed by the outside world.

Some common example of side effect are â€“
making an API request
unpredictable async functions call , etc.

1. useEffect(() => {});  
it will run after every render. 

2. useEffect(() => {}, []);
it will run once after the component has rendered the first time. 

3. useEffect(() => {}, [value1 , value2]);
it will only run when the value inside array will update
